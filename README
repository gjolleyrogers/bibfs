bibfs: A FUSE file system for mounting Bibtex files.

To build and install:

 ; pmake -r install

You can override a few things:

 ; CC=clang PREFIX=$HOME pmake -r install

Building depends on:

 * Any BSD make. This includes OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD make(1)
   and sjg's portable bmake (also packaged as pmake).

 * The FUSE file system front-end needs the FUSE headers to build,
   packaged as libfuse-dev for Debian and friends.

 * A C compiler. Any should do, but GCC and clang are best supported.

 * ar, ld, and a bunch of other stuff you probably already have.

To mount a Bibtex file (-d will prevent FUSE from daemonising itself):

 ; bibfs -d /path/to/bibliography.bib /mnt
