# This is worth some explanation.
#
# Here we generate dependencies as .mk files, and .include them. But .include
# is processed before rules are applied, so these .includes bring in dependencies
# generated from a previous run. For the sake of the first run, the generated
# dependencies are included only if they exist already.
#
# This works out okay, because if the generated dependency files do not exist
# at the time the .include is processed (i.e. this is the first run) then their
# content is moot, because everything would be built for the first time anyway.
#
# The generated dependency files would be outdated for the current run
# if a #include is added or removed in a .c file, but then the .c file itself
# would outdate its target, and so would be rebuilt regardless - leaving behind
# (now correct) generated dependencies for the next run.
